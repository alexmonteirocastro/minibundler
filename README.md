# Basic JavaScript Mini-Bundler

This mini-bundler was built by following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoi6U2fBKhU).

The bundler takes and entry file and maps all its dependencies, thus generating a dependency graph. 

It also transpiles the code of the mapped files into browser-readable code, by using babel's capabilities.
